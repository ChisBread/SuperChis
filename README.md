# SuperChis

SuperChis is an open-source CPLD implementation project designed to understand the principles behind the original SuperCard-like flash carts used in the Game Boy Advance. The project provides complete VHDL source code for educational and research purposes.

## Project Features

- 🔧 **Open Source**: Complete VHDL source code and hardware design files
- 🎮 **GBA Compatible**: Compatibility with Game Boy Advance and NDS
- 💾 **Multi-Storage Support**: DDR SDRAM, Flash memory, and SRAM support
- 💾 **SD Card Interface**: Integrated SD card interface for mass storage
- 🛠️ **Configurable**: Flexible configuration options and memory mapping

## Hardware Architecture

### Main Components
- **CPLD Controller**: Implements GBA interface protocol and memory control logic
- **DDR SDRAM**: High-speed dynamic RAM for large capacity data storage
- **Flash Memory**: Non-volatile memory for ROM data storage
- **SRAM**: Static RAM for save data
- **SD Card Interface**: External storage expansion support

### Interface Description
- **GBA Interface**: 16-bit data bus + 8-bit address bus
- **Memory Interface**: Unified interface supporting multiple memory types
- **Configuration Interface**: System configuration through special addresses
